    or what can be said about it, so which ran is recorded beside the text
    rather than assumed.

    Three of them take something out of the body: the numbered margin of
    pleading paper, a running head, the stamp an ECF system prints when a
    document is filed. `TABLE_AS_TEXT` takes nothing out and changes how a
    region is read. `TABLE_OF_AUTHORITIES` changes nothing at all and marks
    where the index sits, because an entry there names a case and claims
    nothing about it.

    Every rule reads the page -- where an item sits, whether its neighbours
    repeat, what a converter made of a region. A `.txt` file carries no
    geometry, so none of them applies to one, and a rendering made from text
    records that none ran.

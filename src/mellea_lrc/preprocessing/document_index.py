"""Locate the table of authorities, which cites nothing.

A brief opens with an index of the cases it relies on:

    Doe v. Megless , 654 F.3d 404 (3d Cir. 2011) ...................... 8, 12, 13

That entry is a *listing*. It attaches no proposition to the case, makes no
claim about any page of it, and the numbers trailing the dot leaders are pages
of the brief rather than of the reporter. There is nothing in it that can be
right or wrong beyond the case existing.

Extraction cannot see the difference, because by the time the document is text
the index reads like any other run of citations. On false-citation-bench that
is **113 of 302 citation occurrences** in the seven filings that carry an
index -- 37% of them, every one asserting nothing. Counting those beside
citations a brief actually argues from inflates any coverage figure, and
sending them to a pinpoint check spends retrieval on a question nobody asked.

Docling already knows. It labels these tables `document_index`, distinctly from
an ordinary `table`, in 14 of the 20 tables across the corpus. This module
turns that label into character spans over the exported text, so a consumer can
tell an argued citation from an indexed one.

**The index is located, not removed**, because it is independently useful: it is
the document's own declaration of what it cites, and therefore a free check on
whether extraction found everything. An identifier listed in the index and
absent from the body is either a genuine index-only entry or an extraction
miss, and on this corpus the check finds a real one -- `759 F.2d 1032` in
document 007, which reaches the text as `759\\n\\nF.2d 1032` and is lost to the
production tokenizer.

    Measured by rendering the document with the index in place and again with it

    table's text: an index entry repeats verbatim in the body of a brief -- that
    is what an index is -- and a search would have no way to tell which
    occurrence it had found.

    **One table at a time, and by prefix and suffix.** Removing a single item
    deletes one contiguous region, so the two renderings share a prefix and a
    suffix and the difference is what lies between. Comparing them with a block
    matcher instead invites it to pair fragments of the removed index against
    the body text those fragments also appear in, which is not a hypothetical:
    an index this returns as one span came back from `difflib` as 175
    two-character ones.

    Each table is toggled against the *unmodified* rendering, so every span is in
    the coordinates of the text the caller will hold, and removing one index does
    not shift the next.
